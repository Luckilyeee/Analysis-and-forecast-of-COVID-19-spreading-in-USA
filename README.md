# Abstract
COVID-19 is one of the worst pandemics faced by humankind. It is not only the poor country people but also the rich country. The economy reached its nadir during the pandemic. Millions of people died during this time. In this project, we aim to predict future COVID-19 cases by applying different machine learning and deep learning models based on the analysis of COVID-19 data. We also try to see the adverse effect on the US economy by analyzing the changes in the stock price in different domains from the start of the pandemic to April 2022. Various visualization techniques are used in our project to help us analyze the COVID-19 data and the stock market data. Different evaluation metrics are applied to evaluate the performances of different forecasting models.
